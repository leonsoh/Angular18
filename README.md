## About Me

This is my first time trying out Angular/PrimeNG UI. My prior experience is in the native mobile realm (iOS dev) and it was a good experience working on web development.

Functional programming is great for reusable components and isolating functions for unit tests. This has taught me a new way to construct codes instead of Object-oriented programming.

I strongly believe in Reactive programming as well, using Observables or Event-driven programming which helps in real-time data processing to accurately reflect data on the dashboard.

Building this mini project has taught me on some of the nuances in Frontend development like multiple frameworks and libraries to use. Which I encountered a lot during the project, npm install with the latest version of Angular, resulted in some dependencies incompatibility.
Debugging on errors that are happening on the UI due to missing modules or modules not linked properly are also an eye-catching experience.

I am passionate in software engineering in general and this opportunity serves as a great experience even though the project might not be as complete as it seems. I had provided comments on what to do, just that my current limitation on Angular knowledge had posed some difficulties in completing it.

If you have read until here, thank you for your time, cheers! :]
